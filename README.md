## _Project Description_

_This is a webapp built with a React front-end and an Express Node.JS back-end as a proxy to make the API call to IBM's Watson._

_The original proposal for this capstone project was to make two API calls- one to Twitter for a users tweet history, and one to send that history to IBM's Watson to return a personality breakdown based on that history. What I was able to accomplish was to successfully use IBM's Watson to pull that history itself and return that data with just a single API call._

## _Setup/Installation Requirements_

* _Unfortunately IBM has depreciated the api that this app depends on and will no longer provide new API credentials.  For now the only way to use this app would be to contact me directly._
